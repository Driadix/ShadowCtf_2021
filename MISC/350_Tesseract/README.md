I found an ancient puzzle.
Whenever i enter a number it keeps giving me random numbers and i don't know what it means. Maybe it has something to do with the images that they gave. Please help me solve the puzzle.
All I know is that the key is between 16500 and 19000.

Note: The given zip file contains a binary file and a zip file called images.zip. Both the files has to be put in an empty directory before the binary is executed. Reversing the binary is not required to solve the challenge and reversing it will not give any clues.
